"""FastAPI dependency-injection helpers.

These functions resolve process-scoped resources (Neo4j driver, Weaviate
client, spaCy pipeline, flan-t5-base generator, sentence-transformers
embedder) that were constructed once in `main.lifespan` and stored on
`app.state`. Path operations declare these via `Depends()` so the
resource is fetched per request without being re-constructed.

The autograder pins the attribute names — `app.state.neo4j_driver`,
`app.state.weaviate_client`, `app.state.generator`, `app.state.nlp`,
`app.state.embedder` — so use those exact names in both `main.lifespan`
and the helpers below.
